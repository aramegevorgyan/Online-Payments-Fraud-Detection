# 🛡️ Online Payments Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Financial fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem. This project implements a **Machine Learning Classification model** to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. Using a dataset of over 6 million transactions, the model learns to distinguish between legitimate financial activity and fraudulent patterns.

## 📊 Dataset Features
The model analyzes the following transaction attributes:
* **Step:** Unit of time (1 step = 1 hour).
* **Type:** Method of transaction (CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, CASH_IN, TRANSFER, DEBIT).
* **Amount:** Total amount of the transaction.
* **OldbalanceOrg / NewbalanceOrig:** Sender's balance before and after the transaction.
* **OldbalanceDest / NewbalanceDest:** Recipient's balance before and after the transaction.
* **isFraud:** Our target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate).

## 🛠️ Technologies
* **Environment:** Arch Linux 🐧
* **Language:** Python 3.14
* **Core Libraries:** * `Scikit-learn`: For the Decision Tree Classifier.
    * `Pandas`: For data preprocessing and mapping.
    * `Plotly`: For interactive data visualization.

## 🧠 Model: Decision Tree Classifier
For this project, I utilized the **DecisionTreeClassifier**. 
**Why?** In fraud detection, "explainability" is key. A Decision Tree allows us to see exactly why a transaction was flagged (e.g., if a TRANSFER amount is greater than $X$ and the recipient's balance was zero). It handles the categorical nature of transaction types efficiently after mapping.



## 📈 Key Findings & Results
* **Data Imbalance:** During visualization, I discovered that fraudulent transactions represent a very small fraction (<1%) of the total data, making this a classic "imbalanced classification" problem.
* **Model Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of **[Insert your Score here, e.g., 99.9%]**.
* **Preprocessing:** Irrelevant features like `nameOrig` and `nameDest` were dropped to prevent the model from overfitting on specific account IDs.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Prepare Environment (Arch Linux):**
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S python-pandas python-scikit-learn python-plotly
2.The database is to big for pushing in git so download it from this site https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download and change the file name to "datasetmerd.csv"!!!
