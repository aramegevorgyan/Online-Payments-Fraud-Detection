# 🍽️ Waiter Tips Prediction with Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the "Station Project 1: The Prediction". The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the amount of tips a waiter might receive based on several factors like the total bill, day of the week, gender of the payer, and more. 

Predicting tips helps restaurant owners understand service quality and customer behavior, allowing for better resource management.

##  Dataset Features
The model uses the "Tips" dataset with the following columns:
* **total_bill:** Total bill amount in dollars (including tax).
* **tip:** Tip amount in dollars (Target variable).
* **sex:** Gender of the person paying (Encoded: 0=Female, 1=Male).
* **smoker:** Whether the party included smokers (Encoded: 0=No, 1=Yes).
* **day:** Day of the week (Encoded: 0=Thur, 1=Fri, 2=Sat, 3=Sun).
* **time:** Meal time (Encoded: 0=Lunch, 1=Dinner).
* **size:** Number of people in the party.

##  Technologies & Libraries
* **Operating System:** Arch Linux 
* **Language:** Python 3.14
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pandas` & `NumPy`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
    * `Scikit-learn`: Model training and evaluation.
    * `Plotly`: Interactive data visualization.

##  Model Choice: DecisionTreeRegressor
For this project, I chose the **DecisionTreeRegressor**. 
**Why?** Unlike simple linear models, Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns (e.g., "On Saturdays, smokers might tip more during dinner"). It provides a flexible way to segment data into logical branches.

##  Evaluation Results
After training the model on 80% of the data and testing on the remaining 20%, I achieved the following results:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.92 (approx) 
  * *This means the model's predictions are, on average, within 92 cents of the actual tip.*
* **Accuracy (R² Score):** [Insert your score here, e.g., 0.45]
